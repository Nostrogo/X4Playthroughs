# X4 Playthroughs configuration file
# Do not forget to deactivate Steam Cloud for the save files 
# (unless you want steam cloud to overwrite all your playthroughs)
# This is done in the General tab of the game Properties on steam.
# X4Playthroughs must be run with administrator privilege to create a sym link on windows.
# Please configure path to : 
# - x4.save: your Egosoft X4 Foundation save folder
# - x4.exe: your Egosoft X4 foundation executable, currently not used
# Command lines are OS dependant:
# - for windows - x4playthroughs.create.link.cmd: mandatory
# - for windows - x4playthroughs.delete.link.cmd: currently not used
#
# Please note that some command need Administrator privilege (e.g. mklink)
